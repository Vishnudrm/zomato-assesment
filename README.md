# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing Zomato's restaurant data using Python to extract insights and trends. The analysis includes understanding customer preferences, identifying top cuisines, and evaluating pricing strategies. The results aim to support data-driven decision-making in the restaurant industry.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Zomato dataset and generate actionable insights that can help restaurant businesses enhance their performance and customer satisfaction.

## Key Insights
- **Top-rated restaurants and their characteristics.**
- **Popular cuisines across different locations.**
- **Pricing trends and their correlation with ratings.**
- **Impact of customer reviews on restaurant performance.**

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Platform:** Local setup using Python virtual environment (`venv`).

## Dataset
- **Source:** The dataset contains details about restaurants, cuisines, pricing, ratings, and customer reviews.
- **File Name:** `zomato.csv`
